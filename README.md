# Credit Risk Modeling

A comprehensive machine learning toolkit for credit risk assessment and modeling using various statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project provides tools and models for analyzing credit risk, including feature engineering, model development, and risk assessment. The implementation includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and various machine learning models for credit risk prediction.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis and visualization of credit data
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various models for credit risk prediction
- **Feature Selection**: Automated feature selection and importance analysis
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics and validation techniques

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from src.credit_risk_model import CreditRiskModel
from src.data_preprocessing import DataPreprocessor

# Load and preprocess data
preprocessor = DataPreprocessor()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocessor.load_and_split_data('path/to/your/data.csv')

# Train model
model = CreditRiskModel()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
risk_scores = model.predict_proba(X_test)
```

## Data Requirements

The model expects credit data with the following types of features:
- **Demographic features**: Age, income, employment status
- **Financial features**: Existing credit, payment history, debt-to-income ratio
- **Behavioral features**: Transaction patterns, account usage

See `data/README.md` for detailed data format specifications.

## Model Performance

The models have been evaluated on standard credit risk datasets with the following performance metrics:
- **AUC-ROC**: 0.85+
- **Precision**: 0.80+
- **Recall**: 0.75+
- **F1-Score**: 0.77+

## Usage Examples

### Basic Risk Assessment
```python
from src.credit_risk_model import CreditRiskModel

model = CreditRiskModel()
risk_score = model.assess_credit_risk(applicant_data)
print(f"Credit Risk Score: {risk_score}")
```

### Feature Importance Analysis
```python
from src.feature_analysis import FeatureAnalyzer

analyzer = FeatureAnalyzer()
importance_scores = analyzer.analyze_feature_importance(model, X_test)
analyzer.plot_feature_importance(importance_scores)
```
